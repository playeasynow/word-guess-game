        2) DISPLAY # OF LETTERS: show underscores/spaces for each letter in given color name.
        3) DISPLAY RIGHT LETTERS: as user guesses the right letters of the color name, show them on the empty spaces.
        4) DISPLAY # OF GUESSES REMAINING: the user has 10 [full-word or letter] guesess so show how many guesses remain.
        5) DISPLAY LETTERS ALREADY GUESSED: keep track of what letters the user guessed incorrectly.

    <!-- what needs to be coded 
        HTML Layout / CSS
            - spaces where letters/words appear
            - form to enter letters
            - spaces where incorrect letters appear
            - color of the background (advanced: make little 22 degree halo suns in the guessed color appear and float around the screen)
            - font for letters
            - sound for winning
            - sound for losing
            - sound for guessing wrong
            - sound for guessing right
            - box for score: wins/losses, guesses remaining, letters already guessed
        JavaScript
            - array of words (yes, all 140 HTML colors)
            - way to play colors in random sequence (as in, the game will ask you to guess a color in a random sequence from the 140)
            - way to cross check guessed letters against HTML color
            - way to tell you if it belongs in that HTML color
            - way to tell you it does not belong in that HTML color
            - way to count wins/losses
            - way to keep track of letters guessed -->
