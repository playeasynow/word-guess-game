    <!-- HW INSTRUCTIONS -->
    <!-- Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
    Display the following on the page:
    1. Press any key to get started!
    2. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
    3. If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
    4. As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _ _ a.   
    5. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
    6. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
    7. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it. -->

    <!-- GUESS HUE? psuedo code -->
    <!-- Objective of the game: guess the name of a hue i.e. color, before you run out of guesses (10). There are 140 HTML / CSS named colors. How many do hue know? -->

    <!-- Parameters in my own words: -->
    <!-- enter letter by letter until you reveal an HTML / CSS color name. 
        1) DISPLAY # OF WINS: # of times user guessed a color name correctly.
        2) DISPLAY # OF LETTERS: show underscores/spaces for each letter in given color name.
        3) DISPLAY RIGHT LETTERS: as user guesses the right letters of the color name, show them on the empty spaces.
        4) DISPLAY # OF GUESSES REMAINING: the user has 10 [full-word or letter] guesess so show how many guesses remain.
        5) DISPLAY LETTERS ALREADY GUESSED: keep track of what letters the user guessed incorrectly. 
        6) RESET GAME IF WON/LOST: the game should automatically ask the user to guess another word after winning or losing.  -->

    <!-- what needs to be coded 
        HTML Layout / CSS
            - spaces where letters/words appear
            - form to enter letters
            - spaces where incorrect letters appear
            - color of the background (advanced: make little 22 degree halo suns in the guessed color appear and float around the screen)
            - font for letters
            - sound for winning
            - sound for losing
            - sound for guessing wrong
            - sound for guessing right
            - box for score: wins/losses, guesses remaining, letters already guessed
        JavaScript
            - array of words (yes, all 140 HTML colors)
            - way to play colors in random sequence (as in, the game will ask you to guess a color in a random sequence from the 140)
            - way to cross check guessed letters against HTML color
            - way to tell you if it belongs in that HTML color
            - way to tell you it does not belong in that HTML color
            - way to count wins/losses
            - way to keep track of letters guessed -->
